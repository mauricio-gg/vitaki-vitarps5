• A few client-side levers remain even after confirming PS5 ignores the
  StartBitrate hint:

  - Dial in our fallback logic. The soft-restart path is in place, but we’re still
    using hard-coded thresholds (LOSS_EVENT_MIN_FRAMES, LOSS_EVENT_WINDOW_US, etc.
    in vita/src/host.c). Tuning those (or making them adaptive per latency preset)
    can reduce how often we trip the “network unstable” overlay and keep frame
    drops from snowballing.
  - Improve pacing and drop handling. We can extend the existing frame pacing
    metrics (context.stream.measured_incoming_fps) to drive selective frame drops
    or temporary decoder slack when the PS5 overshoots the Vita’s throughput.
    Even without changing the requested bitrate, smarter pacing and queue sizing
    (Takion, H264 decode) can smooth spikes.
  - Expose more telemetry/controls. The docs already note we write per-run logs,
    but surfacing real-time congestion stats (e.g., target_bitrate vs. actual
    throughput) in the UI makes it easier for users to choose the best preset or
    know when to force a reconnect.
  - Investigate LaunchSpec tweaks. Even though the StartBitrate header fails,
    LaunchSpec still advertises our requested bitrate and MTU. We could experiment
    with lowering network.bwLoss/bwKbpsSent or changing appSpecification hints to
    see if the PS5 is more sensitive to those fields than to the header.
