# Deprecated Work

Currently, no epics or features have been formally deprecated. This document will track any planned work that is explicitly dropped or redirected.

## Structure for Future Deprecations

When an epic or task is deprecated, it will be recorded here with the following information:
- **Date Deprecated:** When the decision was made
- **Epic/Task Name:** What was being planned
- **Original Goal:** What it was intended to achieve
- **Reason Deprecated:** Clear explanation of why it was dropped
- **Alternative Approach:** If applicable, what replaced it or what will be done instead
- **Planned Tasks:** Any tasks that were planned but will not be completed

### Example Format

```markdown
## 2025-12-XX

### Epic: [Name]
**Original Goal:** [What it was meant to achieve]
**Reason Deprecated:** [Clear explanation of why this was dropped]
**Alternative Approach:** [If applicable, what replaced it]

#### Planned Tasks (Not Completed)
- Task that was planned
- Task that was planned
```

## Notes
- PSTV (PlayStation TV) support is OUT OF SCOPE per `docs/INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md` - not tracked here as it was never started
- Motion Controls are planned as a future enhancement (stub exists) rather than deprecated
